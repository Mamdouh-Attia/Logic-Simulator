## 🌟 Overview

Logic-Simulator is a modern desktop application for designing, simulating, and analyzing digital logic circuits. Built in C++ with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it provides an intuitive GUI for creating circuits using a variety of logic gates and tools. This project was developed as a college assignment to demonstrate advanced OOP and GUI programming skills.

## 🧠 Design & Architecture

### How We Thought About the Project

- **Modularity:** Each gate is a class derived from a common `Gate` base, allowing easy extension and maintenance.
- **Command Pattern:** Actions like copy, delete, and connect are implemented as commands, enabling undo/redo and clean separation of concerns.
- **Observer Pattern:** The GUI observes changes in the circuit model and updates the display automatically.
- **Factory Pattern:** Gate creation is handled by a factory, simplifying the addition of new gate types.
- **Separation of Concerns:** GUI, simulation logic, and data management are separated into distinct modules for clarity and scalability.

### Project Flow

1. **User Interaction:** The user selects gates and places them on the canvas using drag-and-drop.
2. **Circuit Construction:** Gates are connected via wires; the system checks for valid connections and updates the model.
3. **Simulation:** When the user runs the simulation, the app propagates signals through the gates and displays outputs.
4. **Editing:** Users can copy, delete, or move gates, with all actions tracked for undo/redo.
5. **Persistence:** Circuits can be saved to and loaded from files for future editing.

### Why These Design Choices?

- **OOP:** Enables extensibility (add new gates/features easily), maintainability, and code reuse.
- **GUI:** Makes circuit design accessible and interactive, ideal for learning and prototyping.
- **Patterns:** Command and Observer patterns simplify complex user interactions and state management.

## My Contributions
- Implemented core user action handling through the Application Manager.
- Designed and implemented the `getUserAction()` flow to interpret user inputs.
- Developed key action functions including Save/Load circuits, Change Switch state, and Exit logic.
- Integrated action execution logic within the App Manager.
- Contributed to user interface usability and interaction flow improvements.

## 💡 Example Usage

```cpp
#include "ApplicationManager.h"

ApplicationManager app;
app.addGate("AND", 100, 200);
app.addGate("OR", 300, 200);
app.connectGates(1, 2);
app.simulate();
std::cout << "Output: " << app.getGateOutput(2) << std::endl;
```
